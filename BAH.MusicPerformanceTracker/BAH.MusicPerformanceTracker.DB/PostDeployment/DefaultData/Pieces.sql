	(NEWID(), 'Lincolnshire Posy', 1937, '6', 'Lincolnshire Posy was conceived and scored directly for wind band in 1937. The composer tells us it is a collection of six English folksongs -- a bunch of “musical wildflowers” (hence the title) -- based on tunes collected in Lincolnshire, England mainly in the years 1905 - 1906 with the help of an early phonograph. It is dedicated to the yeomen folksingers who sang so sweetly.

The composer wrote, “Each number is intended to be a kind of musical portrait of the singer’s personality and habits of song, - his regular or irregular wonts of rhythm, his preference for gaunt or ornately arabesqued delivery, his contrasts of legato and staccato, his tendency toward breadth or delicacy of tone”. 

1. “Lisbon” (Sailor’s Song) is a brisk seafaring melody presented several times with changing accompaniment.

2. “Horkstow Grange” (The Miser and his Man: a local Tragedy) The accents shift constantly throughout, as the number of quarter notes in a measure changes from four to five to three and back again.

3. “Rufford Park Poachers” (Poaching Song) emphasizes the piccolo in a high register playing with the alto clarinet. The tune is accompanied by itself in canon by the oboe and bassoon, a unique effect.

4. “The Brisk Young Sailor” (who returned to wed his True Love) is rather simple in contrast to the previous song.

5. “Lord Melbourne” (War Song), begins in free time, heavy and fierce.

6. “The Lost Lady Found” (Dance Song) is the most conventional set- ting of all, in straight 3/4 meter with usual accompaniment patterns. '),

	(NEWID(), 'Rock Music', 2016, '2.5', 'Music doesn''t have to be experienced as an element separate from the rest of our daily lives. It''s as much part of our world as the ground on which we walk. Composing ROCK MUSIC was the perfect opportunity to make this point about the geology of our planet, and the changes in climate that are permanently altering our landscape.

In my ongoing desire to encourage people to step away from their screens and go outdoors, I asked the students of Patrick Marsh Middle School in Sun Prairie, WI to venture out into their neighborhoods, lower their gaze to the substrate on which they walk, find a pair of rocks, discover sounds that can be coaxed from them, and record the results. My inbox was soon filled with nearly 100 mp3s sporting a stunning variety of geological sonic creativity. Many of those sounds, some with distinct pitches and rhythms, are the basis of the accompaniment audio track over which ROCK MUSIC is composed.

In parallel to this holistic vision, band director Chris Gleason invited a scientist from the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey to give a talk to the band students. Brandishing a 3D map that displayed the state''s varying terrain, she spoke of the glaciers that transformed the students'' locales— and mine, on San Juan Island, WA— 15,000 years ago. The students then made video reports that paired their newfound knowledge of local geology with their individual recipes for eliciting sounds from rocks. They also created a video to accompany their performance of the piece, that includes images of polluting factories and transportation. It culminates with sobering footage of an enormous glacier calving, just as the music reaches its loudest, most powerful point. As massive chunks of ice collapse into the water, the audience is reminded of the fragile balance between nature and the actions of humans.

Throughout this geo-electroacoustic piece, the music slowly crawls, melts, and scrapes over a sonic landscape in random, irregular ways: much as the glaciers carved the world we know. And as with our world, the piece''s ending slowly melts away to a haunting silence.'),

	(NEWID(), 'Pictures At An Exhibition', 1874, '6', 'Pictures at an Exhibition (Russian: Картинки с выставки – Воспоминание о Викторе Гартмане, translit. Kartínki s výstavki – Vospominániye o Víktore Gártmane, lit. ''Pictures from an Exhibition – A Remembrance of Viktor Hartmann'', French: Tableaux d''une exposition) is a suite of ten pieces (plus a recurring, varied Promenade) composed for piano by Russian composer Modest Mussorgsky in 1874.

The suite is Mussorgsky''s most famous piano composition and has become a showpiece for virtuoso pianists. It has become further known through various orchestrations and arrangements produced by other musicians and composers, with Maurice Ravel''s arrangement being by far the most recorded and performed.')
